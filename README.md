SQL Questions for Analysis:

1. Data Exploration & Cleaning How many total records are there in the dataset? How many unique customers are in the dataset? What are the distinct product categories in the dataset? Are there any null values in the dataset? If so, how can they be handled?

2. Sales & Revenue Analysis Retrieve all sales transactions that occurred on '2022-11-05'. Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of November 2022. Calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category. Find all transactions where the total sale amount is greater than 1000. Calculate the average sale for each month and determine the best-selling month in each year.

3. Customer Behavior & Demographics Find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category. What is the most frequent age group of customers? Which gender contributes the most to total revenue? Who are the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales? Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category. Find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category. What is the average frequency of repeat purchases by customers?

4. Time-Based Sales Trends Which day of the week has the highest sales volume? What time of the day sees the highest sales in each category? Create shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and calculate the number of orders for each shift. Identify the month with the highest percentage increase in sales compared to the previous month.

5. Product Performance Which product category has the highest profit margin? Find the top-selling product categories based on total revenue. Identify the least-performing product category in terms of sales. Find the most commonly returned products (if return data is available).

6. Revenue Optimization & Discounts Which category sees the most discounting (if discount data is available)? Identify customers who consistently make high-value purchases. Determine whether higher-priced products have a lower quantity sold on average.
